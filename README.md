# Biogeochemical-Drifter
In this repository you will find all files connected to the fabrication of a Biogeochemical drifter.

This drifter project is apart of Stephen Lail's Master's Thesis project. The goal of this project is to create a drifter capable of taking water quality measurments of a single water parcel as the water moves throughout a tidal creek. All code files for the microcontroller will be documented in the .cpp. 

Updates to the sensor development portion of this project will be made under their respective sensor names (i.e. pH, Salinity, Temperature) as needed. Sensor specifications will be documented within each sensors folder.
