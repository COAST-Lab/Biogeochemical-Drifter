# Biogeochemical-Drifter
In this repository you will find all files connected to the fabrication of a Biogeochemical drifter.

This drifter project is apart of Stephen Lail's Master's Thesis project. The goal of this project is to create a drifter capable of taking water quality measurments of a single water parcel as the water moves throughout a tidal creek. All code files for the microcontroller will be documented in the .cpp.
