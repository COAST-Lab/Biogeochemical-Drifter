# Biogeochemical-Drifter
In this repository you will find all files connected to the fabrication of a Biogeochemical drifter.

This drifter project is apart of Stephen Lail's Master's Thesis project. The goal of this project is to create a drifter capable of taking water quality measurments of a single water parcel as the water moves throughout a tidal creek. All code files for the microcontroller will be documented in the .cpp format.

#BOM
The link to the Bill of Materials (BOM) can be found here: https://github.com/Stephen-Lail/Biogeochemical-Drifter/tree/main/BOM
The purpose of this BOM is to provide all design files for the construction of the Biogeochemical drifter as well as supply instructions for its assembly.
