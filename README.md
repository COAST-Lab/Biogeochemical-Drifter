# Biogeochemical-Drifter
In this repository you will find all files connected to the fabrication of a Biogeochemical drifter.

This drifter project is apart of Stephen Lail's Master's Thesis project. The goal of this project is to create a drifter capable of taking water quality measurments of a single water parcel as the water moves throughout a tidal creek. This project is still in the early stages of development, so designs and firmware are still being polished. <br>

### BOM
The link to the Bill of Materials (BOM) can be found here: https://github.com/COAST-Lab/Biogeochemical-Drifter/tree/main/BOM
The purpose of this BOM is to provide all design files for the construction of the Biogeochemical drifter as well as supply instructions for its assembly. <br>

### Data Analysis
The link to the Jupyter Notebook script can be found here: https://github.com/COAST-Lab/Biogeochemical-Drifter/tree/main/Data_Analysis
This script was designed such that these data taken by the drifter can be easily parsed and displayed in an informative manner. <br>

### Firmware
The link to the Visual Studio code used to flash to the Particle Boron can be found here: https://github.com/COAST-Lab/Biogeochemical-Drifter/tree/main/Firmware <br>

### SOP
The link to the Standard Operating procedure can be found here: https://github.com/COAST-Lab/Biogeochemical-Drifter/tree/main/SOP <br>
